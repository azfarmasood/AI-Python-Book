<h2>Layers and Activation Functions</h2>
<p>In neural networks, layers and activation functions play a crucial role in the network's ability to learn complex patterns and make accurate predictions. Layers are the building blocks of a neural network, where each layer consists of a set of neurons that process input data and pass it on to the next layer. Activation functions, on the other hand, introduce non-linearities into the network, allowing it to learn and model complex relationships in the data.</p>
<h3>Layers</h3>
<p>Neural networks are typically composed of multiple layers, each serving a specific purpose in the learning process. The most common types of layers include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input Layer</strong>: The first layer of the network that receives the input data.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Layers</strong>: Intermediate layers between the input and output layers that extract features and learn patterns from the data.</li>
<li><strong>Output Layer</strong>: The final layer that produces the network's predictions or outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each layer in a neural network performs a set of mathematical operations on the input data, transforming it into a more useful representation for the next layer to work with. The number of layers and the size of each layer (number of neurons) are hyperparameters that can significantly impact the network's performance.</p>
<h3>Activation Functions</h3>
<p>Activation functions are applied to the output of each neuron in a neural network to introduce non-linearities into the network's computations. This non-linearity is essential for the network to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. Some common activation functions include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sigmoid</strong>: S-shaped function that squashes the output between 0 and 1, often used in the output layer for binary classification tasks.</li>
<li><strong>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)</strong>: Piecewise linear function that outputs the input if it is positive, and zero otherwise, commonly used in hidden layers.</li>
<li><strong>Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)</strong>: S-shaped function similar to the sigmoid but squashes the output between -1 and 1, often used in hidden layers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Choosing the right activation function for each layer is crucial for the network to learn effectively and converge to a good solution. Experimenting with different activation functions and layer configurations can help improve the performance of a neural network in various tasks.</p>

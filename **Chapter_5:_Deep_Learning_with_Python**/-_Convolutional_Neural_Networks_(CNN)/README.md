<h1>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h1>
<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a type of deep learning algorithm commonly used for image recognition and computer vision tasks. CNNs are inspired by the visual cortex of the human brain and are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data.</p>
<p>CNNs consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers apply filters to the input data to extract features, while the pooling layers downsample the feature maps to reduce computational complexity. The fully connected layers then use the extracted features to make predictions.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of CNNs is their ability to learn hierarchical representations of features directly from raw data, without the need for manual feature extraction. This makes CNNs well-suited for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</p>
<p>Overall, Convolutional Neural Networks have revolutionized the field of computer vision and have been instrumental in the development of various applications, including facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical image analysis.</p>

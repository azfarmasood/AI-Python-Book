<h2>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</h2>
<p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a type of artificial neural network designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a memory of past inputs. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that form a directed cycle, allowing information to persist.</p>
<h3>How RNNs Work</h3>
<p>RNNs process input sequences step by step, updating their internal state with each new input. This enables them to capture dependencies and patterns in sequential data. The output at each time step is influenced not only by the current input but also by the network's previous states.</p>
<h3>Applications of RNNs</h3>
<p>RNNs are widely used in natural language processing tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. They are also applied in speech recognition, time series analysis, and handwriting recognition due to their ability to model temporal dependencies.</p>
<h3>Challenges and Limitations</h3>
<p>One common issue with traditional RNNs is the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients become extremely small during training, hindering learning over long sequences. To address this, more advanced RNN variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have been developed.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Recurrent Neural Networks are a powerful tool for processing sequential data and have found applications in various fields. By maintaining memory of past inputs, RNNs can effectively model dependencies in time-series data and sequential patterns in natural language, making them a valuable asset in the realm of deep learning.</p>

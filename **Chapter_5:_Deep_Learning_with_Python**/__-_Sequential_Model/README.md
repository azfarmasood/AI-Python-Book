<h1>Sequential Model</h1>
<p>A Sequential model in deep learning is a linear stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor. This model is widely used for building various types of neural networks, such as feedforward neural networks and convolutional neural networks.</p>
<p>In a Sequential model, layers are added one by one in a sequential manner, making it easy to understand and implement complex neural network architectures. The model is created using the Keras library, which provides a high-level API for building and training deep learning models.</p>
<p>The Sequential model allows for easy customization of the network architecture by adding different types of layers, such as Dense layers for fully connected networks, Conv2D layers for convolutional networks, and LSTM layers for recurrent networks. Additionally, the model can be compiled with different optimizers, loss functions, and metrics to train the network on a specific task.</p>
<p>Overall, the Sequential model is a powerful tool for building and training deep learning models efficiently, making it a popular choice among researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

<h1>Compiling and Training Models</h1>
<p>In machine learning, compiling and training models are essential steps in the model development process. Compiling a model involves configuring the learning process before training, such as choosing the optimizer, loss function, and metrics to monitor. Training a model refers to the process of feeding data into the model and adjusting the model's weights to minimize the loss function.</p>
<h2>Compiling a Model</h2>
<p>When compiling a model, you need to specify the optimizer, which determines how the model is updated based on the data it sees and the loss function, which measures how well the model is performing on the training data. Additionally, you can define metrics to monitor during training, such as accuracy for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks.</p>
<p><code>python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])</code></p>
<h2>Training a Model</h2>
<p>Training a model involves feeding training data into the model and adjusting the model's weights to minimize the loss function. This is typically done over multiple iterations or epochs, where the model learns patterns in the data and improves its performance. During training, the model's performance on a separate validation set can be monitored to prevent overfitting.</p>
<p><code>python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))</code></p>
<p>By properly compiling and training models, machine learning practitioners can develop models that accurately capture patterns in the data and make reliable predictions. These steps are crucial for building effective machine learning models for various applications.</p>

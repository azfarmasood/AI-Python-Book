<h1>Tokenization</h1>
<p>Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements. Tokenization is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis, as it helps in preparing the text data for further processing and analysis.</p>
<p>During the tokenization process, a text is divided into individual tokens based on certain rules. These rules can vary depending on the specific task or application. For example, in tokenizing a sentence, the tokens are usually words separated by spaces. However, in more complex tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition, the tokens may include phrases or even individual characters.</p>
<p>Tokenization is essential for various NLP tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, machine translation, and more. It helps in standardizing the text data and extracting meaningful information from it. Additionally, tokenization also plays a crucial role in building language models and training machine learning algorithms on text data.</p>
<p>Overall, tokenization is a fundamental process in NLP that enables computers to understand and process human language effectively. By breaking down text into smaller units, tokenization forms the basis for many advanced text analysis techniques and applications.</p>

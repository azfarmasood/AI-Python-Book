<h1>Named Entity Recognition</h1>
<p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more. The goal of NER is to extract relevant information from unstructured text and provide a structured representation of the text.</p>
<p>NER plays a crucial role in various NLP applications such as information retrieval, question answering, sentiment analysis, and more. By accurately identifying named entities, NER helps in improving the understanding and analysis of text data.</p>
<p>The process of Named Entity Recognition involves tokenizing the text into words or phrases and then classifying these tokens into predefined categories based on context and linguistic features. NER models are trained on annotated datasets to learn patterns and relationships between words to accurately identify named entities in text.</p>
<p>Overall, Named Entity Recognition is a fundamental task in NLP that enables machines to understand and extract valuable information from text data, contributing to the advancement of various NLP applications and technologies.</p>

<h1>Lemmatization</h1>
<p>Lemmatization is a natural language processing technique that involves reducing words to their base or root form, known as the lemma. This process helps in standardizing words to their common form, which can improve text analysis and understanding.</p>
<p>Unlike stemming, which simply chops off prefixes or suffixes to find the root word, lemmatization considers the context and meaning of the word before reducing it to its base form. This results in more accurate and meaningful analysis of text data.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of lemmatization is that it helps in reducing the complexity of text data by converting different forms of a word into a single common form. This can be particularly useful in tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>Overall, lemmatization plays a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of natural language processing applications by standardizing words and improving the quality of text analysis.</p>

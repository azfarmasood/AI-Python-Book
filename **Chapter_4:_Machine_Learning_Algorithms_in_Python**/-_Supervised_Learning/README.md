<h1>Supervised Learning</h1>
<p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each input data point is paired with the correct output. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function from the input to the output based on the labeled training data.</p>
<p>In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from the labeled examples provided during the training phase and uses this knowledge to make predictions on new, unseen data. The performance of a supervised learning algorithm is evaluated based on how well it can generalize to new, unseen data.</p>
<p>Common types of supervised learning algorithms include:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Classification</strong>: In classification tasks, the goal is to predict the category or class label of a new data point. Examples of classification tasks include spam detection, sentiment analysis, and image recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regression</strong>: Regression tasks involve predicting a continuous value or quantity. Examples of regression tasks include predicting house prices, stock prices, and temperature forecasting.</p>

<p>Supervised learning is widely used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and more. It is a powerful tool for making predictions and solving real-world problems by leveraging labeled data to train predictive models.</p>

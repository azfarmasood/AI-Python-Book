<h1>Linear Regression</h1>
<p>Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that describes the relationship between the variables.</p>
<p>In a simple linear regression model, there is one independent variable and one dependent variable, which can be represented by the equation:</p>
<p>[ y = mx + b ]</p>
<p>Where:
- ( y ) is the dependent variable
- ( x ) is the independent variable
- ( m ) is the slope of the line
- ( b ) is the y-intercept</p>
<p>The slope and intercept of the line are estimated using the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.</p>
<p>Linear regression is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, biology, and social sciences to analyze and predict relationships between variables. It is a simple yet powerful tool for understanding and interpreting data.</p>

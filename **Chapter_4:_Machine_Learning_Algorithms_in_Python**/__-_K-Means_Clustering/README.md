<h1>K-Means Clustering</h1>
<p>K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into groups based on similarity. The algorithm aims to partition n data points into k clusters where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. </p>
<h2>How K-Means Clustering Works</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialization</strong>: Randomly select k data points as initial cluster centroids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid based on a distance metric (usually Euclidean distance).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update Centroids</strong>: Recalculate the centroids of the clusters by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repeat</strong>: Repeat the assignment and centroid update steps until convergence criteria are met (e.g., centroids do not change significantly).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Key Concepts in K-Means Clustering</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Centroids</strong>: The center point of a cluster, calculated as the mean of all data points in the cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cluster Assignment</strong>: The process of assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inertia</strong>: The sum of squared distances of data points to their respective cluster centroids, used as a measure of clustering quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages of K-Means Clustering</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simple and easy to implement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scalable to large datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient in terms of computational cost.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations of K-Means Clustering</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sensitivity to initial centroid selection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires the number of clusters (k) to be specified a priori.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May converge to local optima depending on initialization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>K-Means clustering is widely used in various fields such as image segmentation, customer segmentation, and anomaly detection. It is a versatile algorithm for exploring patterns and structures within data without the need for labeled training examples.</p>

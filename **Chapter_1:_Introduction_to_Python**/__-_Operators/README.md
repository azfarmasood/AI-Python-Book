<h1>Operators</h1>
<p>In programming, operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands. They are used to manipulate data and perform various calculations in a program. Operators can be categorized into different types based on their functionality, such as arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, assignment operators, and more.</p>
<p>Here are some common types of operators used in programming:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Arithmetic Operators</strong>: These operators are used to perform mathematical calculations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparison Operators</strong>: Comparison operators are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. Examples include equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (&gt;), less than (&lt;), etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logical Operators</strong>: Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and determine the overall truth value. The common logical operators include AND (&amp;&amp;), OR (||), and NOT (!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignment Operators</strong>: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Examples include =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bitwise Operators</strong>: Bitwise operators perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers. Examples include bitwise AND (&amp;), bitwise OR (|), bitwise XOR (^), bitwise left shift (&lt;&lt;), and bitwise right shift (&gt;&gt;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unary Operators</strong>: Unary operators operate on a single operand. Examples include unary plus (+), unary minus (-), increment (++), decrement (--), and logical NOT (!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ternary Operator</strong>: The ternary operator (?:) is a conditional operator that takes three operands and evaluates a condition. It is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding and using operators effectively is essential for writing efficient and error-free code in programming. Each type of operator serves a specific purpose and plays a crucial role in performing various operations within a program.</p>

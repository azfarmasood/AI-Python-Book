<h2>Control Structures</h2>
<p>Control structures are programming constructs that determine the flow of execution in a program. They allow developers to make decisions, repeat actions, and control the order in which statements are executed. Common control structures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Conditional Statements</strong>: These structures allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. Examples include <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>switch</code> statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loops</strong>: Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Common types of loops include <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do-while</code> loops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Flow Statements</strong>: These structures alter the normal flow of program execution. Examples include <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, and <code>return</code> statements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By using control structures effectively, developers can create more dynamic and efficient programs that can respond to different scenarios and conditions.</p>

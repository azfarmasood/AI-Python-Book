<h1>Feature Scaling</h1>
<p>Feature scaling is a technique used in machine learning to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. It is important to scale the features before training a machine learning model to ensure that all features contribute equally to the final results. </p>
<p>There are several methods for feature scaling, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Standardization</strong>: This method scales the features so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is calculated by subtracting the mean of the feature from each value and then dividing by the standard deviation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Normalization</strong>: Normalization scales the features to a range between 0 and 1. It is calculated by subtracting the minimum value of the feature from each value and then dividing by the range of the feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MinMax Scaling</strong>: MinMax scaling scales the features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. It is calculated by subtracting the minimum value of the feature from each value and then dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Feature scaling is essential for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the input features, such as support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors. By scaling the features, the model can converge faster and provide more accurate predictions.</p>

<h2>Train-Test Split</h2>
<p>In machine learning, the train-test split is a crucial step in evaluating the performance of a model. This process involves dividing the dataset into two separate sets: the training set and the testing set. The training set is used to train the model on the data, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.</p>
<p>The train-test split is essential to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. By training the model on a subset of the data and testing it on another subset, we can estimate how well the model will perform on new data in the real world.</p>
<p>It is important to ensure that the train and test sets are representative of the overall dataset to avoid bias in the model evaluation. Common split ratios include 70/30, 80/20, or 90/10, where the training set typically contains a larger portion of the data.</p>
<p>By splitting the data into training and testing sets, machine learning practitioners can effectively evaluate the model's performance, identify potential issues such as overfitting or underfitting, and make necessary adjustments to improve the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.</p>

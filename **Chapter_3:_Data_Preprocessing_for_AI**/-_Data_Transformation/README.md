<h1>Data Transformation</h1>
<p>Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another, with the goal of making it more suitable for analysis, visualization, or other purposes. This process involves cleaning, aggregating, and manipulating data to ensure its accuracy and relevance for the intended use.</p>
<p>Data transformation is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, as raw data often needs to be refined and organized before it can be effectively analyzed.

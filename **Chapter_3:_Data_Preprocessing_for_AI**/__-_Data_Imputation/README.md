<h1>Data Imputation</h1>
<p>Data imputation is a technique used in data analysis and machine learning to fill in missing values in a dataset. Missing data is a common issue in real-world datasets and can lead to biased results and inaccurate predictions if not handled properly. Data imputation helps to ensure that the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.</p>
<p>There are various methods for data imputation, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mean/Median Imputation</strong>: In this method, missing values are replaced with the mean or median of the available data in the same column. This is a simple and commonly used imputation technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mode Imputation</strong>: Mode imputation involves replacing missing values with the most frequent value in the column. This method is suitable for categorical variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation</strong>: KNN imputation involves using the values of the nearest neighbors to impute missing values. This method takes into account the similarity between data points to impute missing values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Imputation</strong>: Multiple imputation is a more advanced technique where missing values are imputed multiple times to create several complete datasets. This helps to account for the uncertainty in the imputed values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regression Imputation</strong>: Regression imputation involves using regression models to predict missing values based on other variables in the dataset. This method is useful when there is a relationship between the missing values and other variables.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Data imputation is an important step in data preprocessing and can have a significant impact on the results of data analysis and machine learning models. It is essential to choose the appropriate imputation method based on the nature of the data and the research question at hand.</p>

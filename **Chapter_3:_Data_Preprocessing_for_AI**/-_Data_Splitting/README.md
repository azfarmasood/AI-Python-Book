<h1>Data Splitting</h1>
<p>Data splitting is a crucial step in the process of building machine learning models. It involves dividing a dataset into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing purposes. This division helps evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data and prevents overfitting.</p>
<p>The most common approach to data splitting is the 70-30 or 80-20 split, where 70% or 80% of the data is used for training the model, and the remaining 30% or 20% is used for testing the model's performance. Another common approach is the k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and tested k times, with each subset used as the testing set once.</p>
<p>Data splitting is essential for assessing the generalization ability of a machine learning model and ensuring that it performs well on new, unseen data. It helps in detecting issues like overfitting and underfitting and allows for fine-tuning the model to improve its performance.</p>
